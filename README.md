# creature_log
A website to document the history of my run ins with various cryptids over the years.
    This project exists to prove my ability to do the following:
        *code a basic html website containing properly formatted text and images
        *organize the different pages and assets that make up the website
        *use git to build a legible changelog with high quality commits
