    <h1>CREATURE LOG</h1>
    <p><img src="images/main.jpeg" height="360" width="640"></p>
    <p>This website serves as a diary to track my close encounters with the cryptids I have come into contact with.</p>
    <p>I have made it my life's mission to hunt and document these dangerous creatures and I in no way encourage you to follow in my footsteps.</p>
    <p>All content contained within this log is very real and you should not attempt to seek out any of the aforementioned creatures if you value your life.</p>
